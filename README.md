📱 Responsive Design

I was going to make this responsive, but my cat sat on my keyboard and deleted all the media queries.
Then I thought about rewriting them, but my Netflix show was about to start...
Now it's been three weeks and honestly, who uses phones anyway? 

(Note: Best viewed on desktop. If you're on mobile, just imagine it looks amazing 😅)

🤝 Contributing

Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome! 
Feel free to add those media queries I was totally going to write... eventually.
